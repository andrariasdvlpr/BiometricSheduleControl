After cloning or downloading this branch, you need to generate the database and tables, sqlite by default. So you need to run inside the folder the command below.

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations 
```
and then. 
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

After that, you need to insert the data, inside the exports folder, in the database. Profile, state and type are the mandatory inserts.
Then modify the settings.py file inside the bsc folder.

```bash
python manage.py 0.0.0.0:80
