## BSC android app

This branch contains an apk, an installation file, and two examples of configuration files. One of them is an example and the other is a template.
After installing the app, it shows you a dialog alert where you might want to select the configuration file. you need to save that file inside the device before opening the app for the first time.

You can change only the `mProtocol` and `mServer` or the completed url, for each key. `mProtocol` depends on how you run the backend code, `mServer` is an IP or a domain name. 

At June of 2021 the default configuration is operative, so you can try the app without run the backend code by your own. The oficial app can be download in the play store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrariasdvlpr.faceclock. Nevertheless if you don´t use the configuration file, the app will use the default backend.

## Warning 

This app started as academic work and continued as a project in a university Chair award (Cátedra MN, University of Vigo). So this app is in Spanish.
